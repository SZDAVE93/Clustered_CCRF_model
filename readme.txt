This project consists of the implementation of proposed model in paper: Yi, F., Yu, Z., et al. An Integrated Model for Crime Prediction Using Temporal and Spatial Factors. In 2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) (pp. 1386-1391). IEEE.

Specifically, the code includes the tree-structured clustering algorithm and the Clustered-CCRF model for crime prediction.

Run the main_model.py can see the model performance, and there are several parameters can be tuned.
